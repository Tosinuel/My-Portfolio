Analyst: Emmanuel (Linux user: analyst)
Environment: Linux Virtual Machine
Tool Used: tcpdump
________________________________________
Objective
To capture and analyze live network traffic using tcpdump on a Linux VM. The goal is to identify active interfaces, apply filters to isolate relevant traffic, and examine a sample packet capture file for deeper insights.
________________________________________
Step 1: Identifying Network Interfaces
Executed the following command to list all available network interfaces:
tcpdump -D
Observation:
The system returned a list of interfaces including eth0, lo, and any. Chose eth0 as the primary interface for external traffic monitoring.

Step 2: Filtering Live Network Traffic
To reduce noise and focus on meaningful data, applied a filter to capture only HTTP traffic:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port 80
Observation:
Captured several packets indicating outbound HTTP requests. This helped isolate web-based activity for further inspection.

Step 3: Capturing Network Traffic
Initiated a full capture session with timestamp and verbose output:
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w live_capture.pcap -vv
Observation:
The capture ran for 5 minutes during peak traffic. Saved the output to live_capture.pcap for offline analysis.
________________________________________
Step 4: Filtering Captured Packet Data
Used tcpdump to read and filter the saved capture file:
tcpdump -r live_capture.pcap host 192.168.1.10
Observation:
Filtered traffic revealed multiple TCP connections between the internal host and an external IP. Noted unusual packet sizes and timing intervals, possibly indicating data exfiltration or beaconing behavior.

Final Analysis of Sample Packet File
Loaded the sample packet capture file from the home directory:
tcpdump -r sample_traffic.pcap
Findings:
•	Detected DNS queries to suspicious domains
•	Identified malformed packets suggesting potential scanning activity
•	Noted repeated SYN packets without ACKs, indicating possible port scanning
________________________________________
Lessons Learned
•	tcpdump remains a powerful tool for real-time and offline traffic analysis
•	Filtering before capture reduces post-processing workload
•	Always validate interface selection to avoid missing critical traffic
________________________________________
Next Steps
•	Correlate findings with SIEM logs
•	Submit suspicious domains for threat intelligence lookup
•	Recommend firewall rule updates to block identified IPs
