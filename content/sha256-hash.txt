Incident Summary
At 1:20 p.m., our intrusion detection system (IDS) flagged suspicious activity on an employee workstation. The alert was triggered by the creation of multiple unauthorized executable files. Initial investigation revealed the source to be a password-protected spreadsheet file downloaded via email. The file executed a malicious payload upon opening.

Observations & Notes
•	The malware is linked to the BlackTech threat actor group and identified as Flagpro, a known payload used in targeted attacks.
•	The spreadsheet file was used as a delivery mechanism, exploiting user trust and bypassing basic email filters.
•	The payload created executables that communicated with external IPs and domains, indicating command-and-control (C2) behavior.
•	VirusTotal sandbox analysis revealed MITRE ATT&CK TTPs such as: 
o	T1059.003 – Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell
o	T1204.002 – User Execution: Malicious File
o	T1105 – Remote File Copy

Next Steps
•	Isolate the affected workstation.
•	Block IP 185.62.189.60 and domain flagpro.blacktech.org across the network.
•	Update detection rules to flag similar spreadsheet-based payloads.
•	Notify internal threat intelligence team for further analysis and correlation.
•	Educate employees on phishing awareness and safe email practices.
